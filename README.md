Sure, I can help you explain this code for your README file on GitHub. Here's a concise breakdown:

### Credit Card Validator using Luhn Algorithm

#### Purpose:
This C++ program validates credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm, which is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers.

#### How it works:
1. **Input**: The program prompts the user to enter a credit card number.
2. **Validation**: It checks if the input is a valid number (consists only of digits).
3. **Checksum Calculation**: It applies the Luhn Algorithm to the credit card number.
   - Starting from the rightmost digit (excluding the check digit), every second digit is doubled.
   - If doubling results in a number greater than 9, the digits of the product are summed.
   - All the resulting digits are summed up.
4. **Validation**: If the total sum modulo 10 equals 0, the credit card number is considered valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
5. **Output**: The program outputs "Valid!" or "Invalid!" based on the result of the validation.

#### Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a credit card number when prompted.
3. The program will output whether the entered credit card number is valid or not.
4. Type 'exit' to quit the program.

#### Example:
```
$ ./credit_card_validator
This program uses the Luhn Algorithm to validate a CC number.
You can enter 'exit' anytime to quit.
Please enter a CC number to validate: 4111111111111111
Valid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: 1234567890123456
Invalid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: exit
```
